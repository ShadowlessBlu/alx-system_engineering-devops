**Postmortem: Web Application Downtime Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: May 13, 2024, 03:00 AM UTC
  - End Time: May 13, 2024, 04:30 AM UTC
- **Impact:** 
  - The web application experienced downtime, resulting in a complete service outage.
  - All users attempting to access the service received HTTP 500 Internal Server Error responses.
  - 100% of users were affected.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured Apache server, leading to internal server errors.

**Timeline:**
- **03:00 AM UTC: Issue Detected**
  - Monitoring alerts flagged high HTTP 500 error rates.
- **03:10 AM UTC: Investigation Begins**
  - Engineers began investigating server logs and configurations to identify the root cause.
- **03:20 AM UTC: Misleading Path**
  - Initial focus was on database performance due to past issues, leading to a misleading investigation path.
- **03:30 AM UTC: Escalation**
  - The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further analysis and resolution.
- **04:00 AM UTC: Root Cause Identified**
  - Strace was attached to the Apache process, revealing a misconfigured LogLevel setting.
- **04:15 AM UTC: Resolution**
  - The Apache configuration file was updated to correct the LogLevel setting.
  - Apache service was restarted to apply the configuration changes.
- **04:30 AM UTC: Service Restored**
  - After the Apache service restart, the web application was fully operational, and users could access it without encountering errors.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - The Apache server was returning internal server errors (HTTP 500) due to a misconfigured LogLevel setting.
  - The LogLevel setting was set too high, causing Apache to log excessive information and overload the server.
- **Resolution:**
  - The LogLevel setting in the Apache configuration file (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf) was adjusted from 'warn' to 'debug'.
  - After updating the configuration, the Apache service was restarted to apply the changes and restore normal operation.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more detailed insights into server errors and performance issues.
  - Implement automated configuration checks to detect misconfigurations like the LogLevel setting.
  - Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to streamline troubleshooting and resolution processes.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement automated Puppet scripts to manage and enforce Apache configuration settings across servers.
  - Conduct regular audits of Apache configurations to identify and address potential misconfigurations.
  - Enhance team training on Apache server management and troubleshooting techniques to improve incident response efficiency.

This postmortem outlines the incident, its timeline, root cause, resolution, and measures for improvement. By addressing the identified issues and implementing preventative measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar outages in the future and ensure the stability and reliability of our web application infrastructure.
